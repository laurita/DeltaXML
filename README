A "quick and dirty" xmldiff tool. Gets two XML documents as input and produces a new XML document which is a modification of one of the input documents. The modifications are presented by adding elements and attributes to mark the differences. 

The implementation is based on an unordered tree model. This is advantageous in a way that it can detect the similarity in case of equal siblings in different order.
